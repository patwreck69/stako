# Stako - Solana APY Staking Platform

## Introduction
Stako is a decentralized staking platform built on **Solana**, enabling crypto projects to offer **APY staking** benefits to their token holders. By simplifying staking mechanics, Stako allows projects to enhance token utility, reward holders, and drive long-term engagement without complex smart contract development.

## Features
- **Seamless Staking Pools** - Projects can launch staking pools with customized APY and staking terms.
- **Auto-Compounding Rewards** - Users maximize their returns with automated compounding.
- **Non-Custodial & Secure** - Stako ensures complete security with audited smart contracts.
- **Flexible Unstaking** - No penalties; users can unstake anytime while forfeiting future rewards.
- **Phantom Wallet Integration** - Simple and smooth wallet connectivity for staking.
- **Real-Time Analytics** - Projects and users can track staking performance live via the Stako dashboard.

## How It Works
1. **Projects Apply** - Submit an application, define staking parameters, and deposit initial rewards.
2. **Staking Pool Deployment** - Stako launches a secure staking contract on Solana.
3. **Users Stake & Earn** - Token holders stake and receive continuous rewards in the projectâ€™s native token.
4. **Real-Time APY Adjustments** - APY dynamically adjusts based on staking participation.
5. **Unstake Anytime** - Users can withdraw at any time but will forfeit future rewards.

## Technology Stack
- **Solana Blockchain** - Fast and scalable blockchain for efficient staking operations.
- **Rust & Anchor Framework** - Secure and optimized smart contracts.
- **React & TypeScript** - Frontend dashboard for projects and users.
- **Solana RPC & Web3.js** - Integration for seamless wallet interactions.
- **Phantom Wallet** - First-phase wallet integration.
